# TwentyFortyEightGame

My implementation of [Gabriele's Cirulli's 2048 game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) in Smalltalk using Pharo (Smalltalk programming language and environment).

The [Pharo 5.0 distribution](https://pharo.org/download-50) was used for the development environment.

The .mcz file can be loaded into Pharo and then you can run it by opening up a Playground in the menu and typing "TheGameClass playGame."

The source code is provided in the .st file.
